# Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer-DL
Implementing Neural Style Transfer algorithm which given a content image C and a style image S can generate an artistic image by using our defined style cost function and content cost function.

## Steps:

1) Open main.py
2) Enter the style image S in the style img path argument
3) Enter the content image C in the content img path argument
4) Set your output image size, learning rate and number of steps if you want to change default parameters
5) Run main.py
